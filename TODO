- Allow to dump a config file, so that when the config is dynamically
   changed, we can find it back after bip restart.

- allow global (or per net ?) IP filtering
- DCC proxying...
- encrypt logs
- pre_on_connect_send => before join

- use gnutls
- MODE #channel and WHO #channel on join

Hi Arnaud,

is it possible to implement a secondary nick option? If I'm connected
directly to IRC, it would be great if BIP fallbacked to the secondary
nickname.

I saw that BIP uses the default nickname + a "`". Where could I change
it to default nickname + "_"?

Thanks a lot for your help.
Best regards,
Whoopie

23:46 < nixternal> i have a question...when i log into my bip server with more
                   than 1 client at a time...i get a mass "ban message" from
                   the server..notice of all channel bans that i am in
23:52 < nohar> one of you client is downloading the ban list
23:52 < nohar> an both recieve the reply
23:52 < nixternal> ahhh
23:52 < nixternal> i am using konversation..so i need to figure how to shut
                   that off
23:53 < nixternal> the ban list for 50 channels sucks ;)
23:53 < nohar> yeah i don't know if you can disable this in konversation. maybe
               we should code a hack for the ban reply to go only to the client
               that asked for it
23:54 < nohar> there is such thing for /who already
